# Project Plan

## Steps

1. Define project goals and objectives
2. Set up the development environment
3. Research and select an appropriate weather API
4. Design API endpoints and response formats
5. Develop and test microservice functionality
6. Implement error handling and logging
7. Deploy microservice to production environment
8. Document API endpoints and usage

## Libraries and Frameworks
- Express.js
- Axios
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Jest
- ESLint
- Prettier
- OpenWeatherMap API

## Assumptions

- OpenWeatherMap API is chosen for its ease of implementation and global coverage
- Microservice will be deployed on a cloud platform, likely Vercel
- Error handling will cover common API errors and network issues
- User guide will include examples and best practices for API usage
- API key and secret management will be handled with environment variables
- Following MVP, caching will be implemented

## Notes

- 100% test coverage is not a goal for this project
- This is a personal project and not intended for commercial use
- Some choices were made based on experimentation and practice, not efficiency
- This document is a work in progress and will be updated as the project progresses
